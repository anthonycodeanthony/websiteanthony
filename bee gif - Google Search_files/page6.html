    3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?
      </p>

        <p> 
            The tools I used for creating my project offered many benefits but were not without their corresponding drawbacks. The main benefits offered by the tools I used and which I have 
            outlined above is that they are tried and trusted. By using what are largely industry standard systems it is much easier to get to grips with the systems. Many are designed to be
            accessible to people who have not used them before. They also.have the benefits of being widely available and widely supported. There are many resources, particularly online, which
            enable the user to progress quickly. The drawbacks are that though designed to be accessible they do require an element of knowledge which can have a steep learning curve. This is 
            exacerbated by the fact that many of the resources I mentioned assume a degree of knowledge which the novice or relative knowledge may not possess. The main factor countering against
             efficiency for me was lack of knowledge. I found myself spending significant amounts of time following incorrect paths which a more experienced developer would not. On reflection more 
             time spent planning would have negated this. Working in teams would certainly have improved the project given the proviso that there was a range on knowledge in the team

            3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efciency
        </p>
        <p> 
          The best way to improve productivity and efficiency would be to begin with a clearer idea of the outcome desired. This would not exactly allow you to begin at the end and work backwards 
          but would certainly enable a clearer focus to be maintained and the individual tasks required for completion of the project to be more effectively defined and achieved. It is difficult 
          to be productive or efficient when energies are being dissipated by poorly defined project goals. This can be boosted by a second element in improving productivity and efficiency, that 
          is teamwork. A team in which each member has clearly defined goals and a timescale in which to achieve them is always likely to be more efficient than one person attempting one overall 
          task themselves.

            3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what
            would you do diferently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? 
        </p>
        <p>
           In order to improve ones own productivity you must first identify your weaknesses. My main weakness in attempting this project was lack of knowledge. Before attempting any solution I had 
           to understand the problem and then lean the procedures to solve the problem before actually carrying out the solution. This significantly increased the time needed to carry out any task. 
           On reflection it would have been beneficial to take some time to increase my basic knowledge before attempting the project. It may well have been more beneficial in the long run. I may 
           also have been more open to asking for help from my fellow students. This could have been facilitated by use of slack. It may have been that colleagues had easy solutions to problems I 
           was struggling with
</p>

<p>
    3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions 
</p>
           <p>
           In order to test a digital solution you would first have to define problem the solution was intended to address. Having defined that it would be advisable to test the solution beyond the
           intended limits of the solution. This will ensure it is unlikely to break down in everyday use. It is advisable for this testing to be carried out by people not associated with the project. 
           This is often called Beta testing. It offers two benefits. Firstly the beta testers may well be more objective and so are less likely to be forgiving of elements which may be favoured by the 
           project team. The second benefit of this type of testing is that people outside the project may well address issues not considered by the team and thus highlight weaknesses or gaps in the 
           solution.

              1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page 
           </p>
           <p>
           My website adopted a bee theme. The home page was a section about me with a large bee image. The second page was addressing the first outcome unit with text in black bordered boxes and and 
           gif of bees flying around a hive which repeated across the page. Page two and three repeated the layout addressing the second and third unit outcomes.

              1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints afecting websites 
           </p>
           <p>
           Perhaps the main copyright constraints affecting websites is the need to avoid copyright infringement. It is easy to fall into the trap of assuming that because something is on the  internet 
           it is free to use. In fact the normal copyright laws are likely to apply. One must also be careful to comply with the GDPR regulations regarding data held by the website. Beyond the copyright 
           restraints the are other constraints of technology which may limit a website’s effectiveness. I website owner must cut their cloth carefully. You will not be able to deliver a performance to 
           rival google’s if you are running your site from a single lap top.

    1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that
    people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome
    them 
</p>
           <p>
           It is difficult to detail the problems people with disabilities have with websites without having a disability. There are, however, certain areas where it is clear disability may hamper a users 
           ability to access a website. A blind person or someone who is partially sighted  will  have difficulty reading the sight. The deaf will be unable to access any audible content and some physical 
           disabilities such as arthritis may make operating a mouse or keyboard difficult. Such difficulties have long been addressed in other areas and solutions are available which may be easily adapted 
           to a website. Software is available which will describe content as is Braille keyboards. Clear descriptive options may help a deaf person more fully access the site. Keyboards and mice which may 
           benefit a person with a physical disability are also available. If the website is clearly and simply designed it may also help someone with learning difficulties navigate and use the site.

    1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites 
</p>
<p>
  The most appropriate file types for websites will be largely determined by the type of site you are designing. Some of the most commonly used for a simple website are HTML for the text, CSS to style the 
  site and JPEG and GIF to add images and animation to the site.
