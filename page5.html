<h1> UNIT 2</h1>
  
    <p>
    2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello 
        </p>

    

<p> 
  The nature of IT is such that the tools both available and used are liable to swift and regular change. Many of the tools used for my website project are current industry standard and as such tried and 
  tested. For someone coming for a position of limited  computer knowledge they are the logical solution. Though many of these tools have a strong learning curve they are all reasonably accessible. 
   With effort, practice and support they will help create a functional website. Of the tools I used none were particularly difficult but some were harder than others. I found VS Code fairly intuitive 
   while Git Hub was somewhat harder. There were none I would be afraid of using in the future.

  <p>
      2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello 
    </p>

    <p> 
      I Found all the IT tools I used appropriate. The difficulty I found was in identifying which tool was appropriate for each task. On a number of occasions I found myself struggling before eventually 
      realising that the tool I was using was either not appropriate of being used incorrectly. In such situations it is appropriate to view the whole process as a learning process and consider such 
      situations as learning points rather than mistakes. I was particularly impressed with trello which allowed me to identify, track and count off each task in each step of the project.

      <p>
          2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? 
      </p>


    <p> 
      The question of whether or not I am happy with my website can only be answered by considering what I hoped to achieve. Coming form a non technical background with no previous experience of 
      either coding or web development it was clear to be that I was never going to be able to create an  all singing all dancing website displaying all the tricks of the developer’s trade. My aim 
      was to produce a functioning website which incorporated some of the basic elements of web design and demonstrated a reasonable grasp of them. In that I think I have succeeded. If I were to 
      change anything it would be to include some of the more complex elements which it currently lacks. In a few weeks I may be able to.

    2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose 

</p>
      <p> 
        I have already highlighted in broad terms what improvements I would make to my website if able to. In more detailed terms I would add more complex elements such as animated backgrounds 
        and perhaps embedded film. I would also make to site more subtle. Taking some of the existing elements and tone them down, suggesting them rather than stating them in such bold and, perhaps,
        simplistic form. It would be very easy to see these two elements as being separate. I do not believe they are. In many creative areas complexity and subtlety frequently go hand in hand
