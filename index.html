         <h>/ Describing the purpose of IT in modern business <h1>
           <p><

            IT is one of the central pillars of modern business. From the humblest
             market stall to the largest global enterprises, none could now function 
             without IT.  It is the engine  of innovation and the platform for efficient 
             daily function. For any business a sound IT operation will be one of its 
             prime concerns. So intimately is IT woven into the framework of modern 
             business that it would be almost impossible to list all the ways. There 
             are, however some areas in which IT’s use in business is immediately 
             apparent. One such is communication. IT’s use to business the total 
             number of business and consumer emails exchanged each day is expected 
             to exceed 293 billion a day in. 2019 and is predicted to surpass 347 
             billion by 2023. (1). Without IT effective communication with customers 
             would be extremely difficult. So much so that it is tempting to ask 
             how businesses managed to communicate both internally and with their 
             customers before IT.
             <br>
             If IT’s purpose in modern business can be encapsulated in a single word 
             it may well be efficiency. Stock control is streamlined, security is 
             tightened, research and development projects are both shortened and 
             significantly more cost effective; it is easier and cheaper, for a 
             car manufacturer to build a virtual engine than a real one. Manufacturing 
             processes are similarly simplified.
             <br>
             IT’s contribution to business has led a change in the role of IT departments 
             within businesses. They have shifted from being support departments to the 
             main driver of business development and growth. (2) Though this trend is 
             certain to continue and accelerate IT is such a volatile and fast changing 
             environment it would be reckless to try to predict exactly how predict

           <</h1>  Describe how the methods, skills, and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully.<h1><

            <p> 
                One of the key elements in complete  a digital project is a clear project 
                management strategy. It is therefore essential to have a tool which allows 
                you to do this. A Trelllo account (3) Along side these you will need effective 
                time management,  prioritisation, a keen attention to detail and a capacity to 
                question everything. These key skills will be well balanced if paired with a 
                degree of assertiveness and a facility to work well under pressure, to be a 
                critical thinker and a readiness to embrace change.

            <h1> Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board. 
              </h1>

              <p> 
                I will begin by clearly defining the  final outcome of the project. I will then breakdown the overall task into smaller 
                elements. Having down so I will place these on my trello board (4). This  will enable me to focus on on a single task at 
                a time rather than attempting multiple tasks at a time. It will also ensure I have a clear picture of where I am with any 
                given task at any stage of the project. I will also  be careful to address negative aspects of the project whilst remaining 
                open to new information which may alter or even undermine the project.
