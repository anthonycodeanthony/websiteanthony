    <p>
        1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business 
        </p>
    <p>
          
        IT is one of the central pillars of modern business. From the humblest
             market stall to the largest global enterprises, none could now function 
             without IT.  It is the engine  of innovation and the platform for efficient 
             daily function. For any business a sound IT operation will be one of its 
             prime concerns. So intimately is IT woven into the framework of modern 
             business that it would be almost impossible to list all the ways. There 
             are, however some areas in which IT’s use in business is immediately 
             apparent. One such is communication. IT’s use to business the total 
             number of business and consumer emails exchanged each day is expected 
             to exceed 293 billion a day in. 2019 and is predicted to surpass 347 
             billion by 2023. (1). Without IT effective communication with customers 
             would be extremely difficult. So much so that it is tempting to ask 
             how businesses managed to communicate both internally and with their 
             customers before IT.

             1.2  Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? 
            </P>
            
            <p>
            One of the key elements in complete  a digital project is a clear project management strategy. It is therefore essential to have a tool which allows you to do this. 
            A Trelllo account (3) Along side these you will need effective time management, prioritisation, a keen attention to detail and a capacity to question everything. 
            These key skills will be well balanced if paired with a degree of assertiveness and a facility to work well under pressure, to be a critical thinker and a readiness 
            to embrace change.
</p>

               <br>
             
   
        <p>
            1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board. 
        
            <br>

        </p> 
                I will begin by clearly defining the  final outcome of the project. I will then breakdown the overall task into smaller 
                elements. Having down so I will place these on my trello board (4). This  will enable me to focus on on a single task at 
                a time rather than attempting multiple tasks at a time. It will also ensure I have a clear picture of where I am with any 
                given task at any stage of the project. I will also  be careful to address negative aspects of the project whilst remaining 
                open to new information which may alter or even undermine the project.

                <p>
                    1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? 
                </p>


                  <p>

                      The risks which may affect a project fall in to two categories; known and un known. Known factors can broadly be defined 
                      as things we are aware of and understand while unknown factors can equally broadly be defined as things we are neither 
                      aware of nor understand.  These can be further broken down into known known and known unknowns. These are considerably 
                      simpler to understand that their descriptions suggest.  A known unknown is something we are aware of during planning but 
                      are not yet in position to respond to. A unknown is something we are not aware of and do not yet know how we should respond 
                      to. To address these issues wen should always have a risk management strategy built into the project. In simple terms we need
                       a plan B. (4) The reasons projects fail are relatively straightforward. One of the main reasons is lack of focus. The people 
                       running the project simply don ’t have a clear enough vision for the project. Running alongside this is, of course, a poor 
                       planning. The danger of “mission creep” where the project begins with one aim the spins out into other areas must be guarded 
                       against. Unrealistic goals, poor communication and a failure to effectively test can also be harmful to a project.

  <p>
      1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? 
  </p> 

  <br>

</p>
 The IT systems and software used for any project will be determined by the outcome you want to achieve. There ae defined methods for selecting such tools.(5) Once the outcome has been fully defined. 
 For the creation of a small website the software and systems will be both relatively simple and readily available. There will be no need to 
 incorporate complex or bespoke systems. Regarding hardware a simple Mac book should be sufficient. A coding platform will be necessary. 
 VS Code is perhaps the most widely available and easily accessible. A reasonable grasp of a coding language such as javascript will also 
 be useful. A project management system such as trello and Kanban will be essential. You will also need some means of launching your website. Git and Git Hub are the most commonly used.      
<p>

    <br>

    <p>

    1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control 
</p>

<p>
The technologies I used in carrying out my project are very similar to those outlined earlier. The hardware I used was a Mac book. This 
was an excellent machine though at times counter intuitive for someone used to a dell desktop.  The coding language I used was jacvascript 
which took some effort to learn but got progressively easier once the basics had been grasped. All coding  was done in VS Code. A 
straightford system though one which which has its quirks. Once coded all elements were pushed to Git Hub which I must confess I 
did not find a seamless process. I planned and tracked my project using a trello board. 
  </p>

  <p>
      1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? 
  </p>



      <p> 
        The main legal constraint on IT projectS is GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation.(6) This governs how data is obtained, handled and distributed. Anyone holding data need a clear and unequivocal 
        reason for holding the data and how it will be stored. No information should be stored beyond the essential. There will have to be a clear management structure with a senior manager designated to take 
        responsibility for the data. These responsibilities take on even greater significance when one discovers that there are punitive fines for failure to comply with the regulations, up 20 million euros or 
        4% of global turn over. (7)
